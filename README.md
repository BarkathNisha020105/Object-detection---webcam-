# Real-Time Object Detection using OpenCV

## 📌 Overview
This project performs object detection on both images and real-time webcam feed using OpenCV. It identifies objects and displays bounding boxes around them.

## 🚀 Features
- Detects objects in images
- Real-time detection using webcam
- Bounding box visualization
- Simple and fast processing

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
pip install opencv-python numpy

2. Run the script:
python main.py

## 📊 Results
- Successfully detects objects in real-time
- Works best under good lighting conditions

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Integrate deep learning models (YOLO/SSD)
- Improve detection accuracy
- Add multiple object tracking
